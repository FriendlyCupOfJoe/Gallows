# Gallows
A console application of the game Gallows made with C++. Goal of the game is to find the hidden word (every hidden letter is represented with a underscore sign) before the gallows are fully constructed. Player inputs letter by letter and if it's not the required letter a piece of the gallows is constructed. Text file "words" holds the hidden words for the game. 

If there are problems with the command consolse window you can fix them by right clicking on the top of the window -> Properties -> Font/Layout and change the font and window size.
